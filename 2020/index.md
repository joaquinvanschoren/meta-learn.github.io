Recent years have seen rapid progress in meta-learning methods, which learn (and optimize) the performance of learning methods based on data, generate new learning methods from scratch, and learn to transfer knowledge across tasks and domains. Meta-learning can be seen as the logical conclusion of the arc that machine learning has undergone in the last decade, from learning classifiers, to learning representations, and finally to learning algorithms that themselves acquire representations and classifiers. The ability to improve one’s own learning capabilities through experience can also be viewed as a hallmark of intelligent beings, and there are strong connections with work on human learning in neuroscience.

Meta-learning methods are also of substantial practical interest, since they have, e.g., been shown to yield new state-of-the-art automated machine learning methods, novel deep learning architectures, and substantially improved one-shot learning systems.

Some of the fundamental questions that this workshop aims to address are:

- How can we exploit our domain knowledge to effectively guide the meta-learning process?
- What are the meta-learning processes in nature (e.g, in humans), and how can we take inspiration from them?
- Which ML approaches are best suited for meta-learning, in which circumstances, and why?
- What principles can we learn from meta-learning to help us design the next generation of learning systems?
- What are the fundamental differences in the learning “task” compared to traditional “non-meta” learners?
- Is there a practical limit to the number of meta-learning layers (e.g., would a meta-meta-meta-learning algorithm be of practical use)?
- How can we design more sample-efficient meta-learning methods?

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from all the different communities and topics that fall under the umbrella of meta-learning. We expect that the presence of these different communities will result in a fruitful exchange of ideas and stimulate an open discussion about the current challenges in meta-learning, as well as possible solutions.

In terms of prospective participants, our main targets are machine learning researchers interested in the processes related to understanding and improving current meta-learning algorithms. Specific target communities within machine learning include, but are not limited to: meta-learning, AutoML, reinforcement learning, deep learning, optimization, evolutionary computation, and Bayesian optimization. Our invited speakers also include researchers who study human learning, to provide a broad perspective to the attendees.

## Submission Instructions

Papers must be in the latest [NeurIPS format](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/PaperInformation/StyleFiles), but with a maximum of 4 pages (excluding references).

Papers should be anonymized upon submission.

Accepted papers and eventual supplementary material will be made available on the workshop website. However, this does not constitute an archival publication and no formal workshop proceedings will be made available, meaning contributors are free to publish their work in archival journals or conferences.

The two best papers submitted will be presented as 15-minute contributed talks.

Submissions can be made at [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/METALEARN2019/Submission/Index](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/METALEARN2019/Submission/Index)
during the submission period.

### FAQ

1. Can supplementary material be added beyond the 4-page limit and are there any restrictions on it?

   Yes, you may include additional supplementary material, but you should ensure that the main paper is self-contained, since looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers. The supplementary material should also follow the same NeurIPS format as the paper and be limited to a reasonable amount (max 10 pages in addition to the main submission).

2. Can a submission to this workshop be submitted to another NeurIPS workshop in parallel?

   We discourage this, as it leads to more work for reviewers across multiple workshops. Our suggestion is to pick one workshop to submit to.

3. If a submission is accepted, is it possible for all authors of the accepted paper to receive a chance to register?

   We cannot confirm this yet, but it is most likely that we will have at most one registration to offer per accepted paper.

4. Can a paper be submitted to the workshop that has already appeared at a previous conference with published proceedings?

   We won't be accepting such submissions unless they have been adapted to contain significantly new results (where novelty is one of the qualities reviewers will be asked to evaluate).

5. Can a paper be submitted to the workshop that is currently under review or will be under review at a conference during the review phase?

   MetaLearn submissions are 4 pages, i.e., much shorter than standard conference submissions. But from our side it is perfectly fine to submit a condensed version of a parallel conference submission, if it also fine for the conference in question. Our workshop does not have archival proceedings, and therefore parallel submissions of extended versions to other conferences are acceptable.

6. Are there any instructions for poster formatting or for the camera-ready?

- Posters should be A0, preferably on light paper. Poster can be hung up before the start of the workshop or during the breaks or poster sessions.
- The camera-ready version of your accepted paper should be limited to 4 pages, with up to 10 pages additional materials.
